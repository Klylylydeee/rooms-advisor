                            <a id="main-context">An apartment (also known as a service apartment or an extended
                                stay apartment) is a fully furnished apartment available for short-term or long-term
                                stay, providing hotel-like amenities such as room service, house keeping, a fitness
                                center, a laundry room, and a rec room. Most of them are equipped with full kitchens,
                                Wi-Fi and in-apartment washers and dryers.Companies frequently use serviced apartments
                                to host professionals who may be on a local or international work assignment. It is
                                common for executives to stay in serviced apartments temporarily while searching for a
                                permanent residence or relocation. Although serviced apartments are primarily occupied
                                by business executives, they are also available to the general public.Serviced
                                apartments offer facilities much like an apartment hotel but provides more space,
                                convenience and privacy. They have private cooking facilities, sometimes a kitchenette
                                but sometimes a full-size kitchen with dishwasher and washing machine, living and
                                sleeping areas that are larger than most standard rooms, and often having access to
                                gyms, restaurants, meeting space, concierges and other hotel-like services.
                                Their services usually include towel replacement, toiletteries change, making of bed,
                                and cleaning.An apartment hotel complex usually offers a complete fully fitted
                                apartment. These complexes are usually custom built, and similar to a hotel complex
                                containing a varied amount of apartments. The length of stay in these apartment hotels
                                is varied with anywhere from a few days to months or even years. The people who stay in
                                apartment hotels use them as long-term accommodation; therefore, the hotels are often
                                fitted with most things the average home would require.Apartment hotels were first
                                created in holiday destinations as accommodation for families that needed to "live" in
                                an apartment rather than "stay" as they would in a hotel. The apartments would provide a
                                "holiday home" but generally be serviced. Later, these apartments evolved to be complete
                                homes, allowing occupants to do everything they would at home, such as cleaning,
                                washing, and cooking.</a>
