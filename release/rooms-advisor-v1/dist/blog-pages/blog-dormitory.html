                            <a id="main-context">A dormitory (originated from the Latin word dormitorium, often
                                abbreviated to dorm) is a building primarily providing sleeping and residential quarters
                                for large numbers of people such as boarding school, high school, college or university
                                students. In some countries, it can also refer to a room containing several beds
                                accommodating people.

                                Worldwide, dormitories are often single sex, or sexes are accommodated on separate
                                floors or in separate rooms in some cases. It is unusual for unrelated mixed sex
                                occupancy of a bedroom except temporarily (for example in a [travel] hostel or a railway
                                sleeping car). Where this does occur, it is so remarkable as to be newsworthy (for
                                example the mixed sex sharing of bedrooms in the Norwegian Army).The terms "dorm" and
                                "residence hall" are often used interchangeably in the US. However, within the residence
                                life community, the term "residence hall" is preferred. According to the University of
                                Oregon, their facilities "provide not just a place to sleep, but also opportunities for
                                personal and educational growth. Highly trained Residence Life staff and Hall Government
                                officers support this objective by creating engaging activities and programs in each
                                hall or complex."Halls located away from university facilities sometimes have extra
                                amenities such as a recreation room or bar. As with campus located residence halls,
                                these off-campus halls commonly also have Internet facilities, either through a network
                                connection in each student room, a central computer cluster room, or Wi-Fi. Catered
                                halls may charge for food by the meal or through an termly subscription. They may also
                                contain basic kitchen facilities for student use outside catering hours. Most halls
                                contain a laundry room. As of 2015 there was an expanding market for private luxury
                                off-campus student residences which offered substantial amenities.Boarding schools must
                                provide a total floor area of at least 2.3 mÂ² living accommodation for every boarder.
                                This should also be incorporated with at least one bathtub or shower for every ten
                                students. These are some of the few guidelines set by the department amongst many
                                others. It could probably be observed that not all boarding schools around the world
                                meet these minimum basic standards.</a>
